# Monte Carlo simulation that allows users to input parameters and return budget distributions

# This source code is a Beta model in R that runs a Monte Carlo simulation basedon parameter inputs, for use in salary negotiation scenarios. Since this code is computationally cumbersome, but not database-intensive, I decided to make it open source, and I am working on using an R framework like Shiny to turn this into a web application. 

# The code consists of four scripts, and two data connections: data connections that connect into a tax bracket with federal and state data; three function scripts: state tax rate, federal tax rate (per the department of commerce), and the montecarlo function, and finally the parameter input, which will be the raw user input.

# In this application, the following dependencies are used: 'XML', 'optimx', 'fGarch', 'reshape2', "xlsx", "shiny"
